Split it,

does it scare you?

Because your father couldn’t handle it.

I remember when two walls,

made me feel free.

I could use them to climb

to get height

to feel – adrenaline.

Escape the confines.




Now two walls, 

claustrophobic – 

the walls haven’t changed.




Can we not grow, are we not seeds still,

destined for some glory,

or must we be punished,

due to trauma, divinity, epigenetics. 




Free will, Illusions, emergent phenomena, 

but to every bell curve, for every number,

there is always an outlier, 

outside our box of comfort, 

outside our conceptions of reality, 

outside things we fear.




Often – I only pray for things to be

okay.




Nothing more – nothing less.

okay.
