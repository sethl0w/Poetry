We sway in darkness 

our feet, our hips, our shoulders.




Even when I was alone, 

you could lift me up.




Your love flowed, 

even when I could not give back.




Even when, I wanted it to end.

when you wanted it to end.




Your love flowed,

until the very end.




I threw out 

all the rocks, seashells, trinkets,

that we had.




Itâ€™s over. 

I felt it in my stomach.

Just another rock.

Just another love.

Just another.
