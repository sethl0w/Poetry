When my heart broke for the first time.

I was in between worlds.

Innocence makes no sense when youâ€™re nineteen. 

You feen for attention, you hold onto affection.

You can only beg for definition. 

I used to sit in the McDonalds.

Alone

drinking whisky. Cheap.

Just put words on paper of how

I was feeling. 

Id walk to times square,

That I despised 

Just to see faces of people 

Who did not care 

Nor would ever care

Of who I am or what happened to me.

We could walk hand in hand 

they allow me to be a tourist in my own city.
