I have been feeling a vague sense of emptiness

deep in the pit 

In the core of my being

I can not be alone in this cage

That philosophy nor god 

can fill,

This cup that is always half empty.

But Iâ€™m willing to share,

what little is in my cup 

as a 27-year-old 

heeding his time 

alone in this thunderstorm

with lighting as my light show

The oceans waves as my orchestra

the moon as my muse.
