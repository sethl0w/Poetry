You never responded… 

after I hurt you, after I told you how I feel…

it was after a dream, some sort of premonition, 

I felt alone even with you in my bed. 

Is it wrong… to still want to talk… 

I was hoping we could still be friends.

Maybe take it slow, I guess you want nothing to hear

from me. Like salt in your eyes. 

I can’t even think when I’m at work, 

I try to bide the time, 

I knew even then that this is something I would regret.

I was hoping you’d hear me out.

Maybe you’d understand me.

Give me time to mourn around me.




I expect too much from people. 

I should steep my expectations like a used tea bag.




Its not fair what you said – about me wanting to hear myself

I want to talk myself out into you.

Until there is nothing left to be said.

Until I sit there in silence 

that the emptiness inside me will be hollow enough to 

let you inside.
