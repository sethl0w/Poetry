I started to dig my grave,

two years ago – 

time is limited.

Better to get started,

head started,

my body vibrates like a cello,

a speaker, ready to burst, distorted,

a pinball machine,

a gamblers wet dream – three sevens. 




It’s scary to not have control

To feel the whole world against you.

somebody dug their grave,

faster than me.

but I’ll move an inch at a time,

take my time,

count the stones,

the worms.

every funeral, every cemetery 

I always feel – see the insects,

they start and finish everything.




All I can ask for 

is more time.
