In the shade of night,

When everything goes dark,

When you feel most alone,

With no one to hold you,

With no one to touch the soil in the earth.

Do you ask,

Is it worth it?

When they fought 

what you heard

are you dense – 

you built all this armor 

just to be hurt inside – it – reverberates.

To sit idle when life passes, us by.

Is there something more

Often, we ask ourselves 

Alone – maybe in the shower,

Maybe not alone

But feeling lone.

Self-sabotage, do you think,

Jihad is just self-hate convinced for love.

Is there justice in bringing justice 

In hurting others to feel yourself right. 

Or when they ask for money,

For something they never did.

He feels no shame in asking, 

He would never beg forgiveness.

He finds himself just.
